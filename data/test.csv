Well I guess I should start by saying I am man of the details, so this will be hard for me...but I'll do my best. 

I grew up in Elizabeth NJ and had a great childhood. As a kid I lived on video games, skateboarding, playing basketball and anything/everything related to computers. I remember spending hours building DOOM levels from scratch on editors I would download from any BBS system I could connect to (yeah I am aging myself). But even with all the things I would learn on my own at home about computers, I was a TERRIBLE student in school, barely making a C average in High School. Due to this, I leaned toward the only thing I was good at...art. 

I spent 5 years at FIT (Fashion Institute of Technology) getting an Illustration degree and then changing Majors to Graphic design. I learned that as a color blind, mediocre artist, I would have a really hard time making any money so switched to Graphic design to leverage my computer knowledge while staying in the creative industry. During my last year in school and my first year working I taught myself HTML and basic PHP so I too could join all of the young people making hundreds of thousands of dollars during the web boom that was happening all around me...needless to say that did not happen, but was the catalyst for what became my career. 

After about 1 year working I had an opportunity to join a startup as employee #5 called eFashion Solutions. This company was a turnkey ecommece fashion apparel company that created and ran websites for fashion companies. We would hold all the stock on consignment, do all the online marketing, process and fulfill all the orders, all for a commission on the sale. We ran sites for some of the biggest urban brands at the time such as Baby Phat, Phat Farm, Rocawear, enyce, and Shady. Eventually we diversified into other brands such as Ashley Stewart, New ERA Hats, Mandee, and DKNY. Over the course of my 12 years there I helped grow the company from 5 to 250 staff members, moving from the owners apartment all the way to a 125sq ft facility, and held many titles such as Graphic Designer, Creative Manager, Project Manager, and eventually left as the Sr. VP of Operations.

After the company had it's 3rd round of layoffs (a story for another time) I decided that it was time to move on and reached out to someone I had known through Vistage who I greatly admired...Jeffrey Bershad, CEO if Phillip Jeffries. 

I am now going into year 12 at PJ and have leveraged much of what I learned through my experience at eFashion to help grow PJ from 33 employees (I was #33) to 300 and from  10m in sales to well, well past that! During my time at PJ my focus has been on Warehouse Operations, IT, Customer Service/Experience and Project Management. 

Everything I have learned has been ""on the job training"", tons of reading and executive peer groups like COO Alliance. I am a ""systems"" guy...I LOVE learning about processes, systems and methodologies and while they say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach mine would be with white boards and flow charts!!

This job gave me great insight into how successful companies are structured and was exposed to different ways to run a business.  It also taught me how to work hard and think strategically.  

I figured I would go back to school and get my MBA when my brothers-in-law approached me about joining their small company running a Court Reporting school in Los Angeles.  At the time I wasn't much of a risk-taker, hence my choice to become an accountant, but for some reason I said yes.  It has been a great decision.  We have been able to grow what was a $6MM company into an $30MM+ company.  I started overseeing the accounting and now serve as the CFO and COO of the company and as a member manager.  I have learned a lot of great lessons along the way as we have acquired some small schools, had to deal with a very volatile regulatory environment, and found ways to grow despite being in a market that has seen a lot of consolidation.

Personally, I am a drummer, skier, paddle surfer, and a father of 3.  My family and my faith bring me the greatest joy to me in my life.  I love being active but have had challenges trying to remain active and doing the things that I love as I was diagnosed with leukemia when I was 18 which resulted in me developing avascular necrosis in my knees, hips, and shoulders as well as neuropathy in my knees.  This has caused me to get bilateral knee and hip replacements.  I have learned great lessons on overcoming obstacles, patience, and understanding what matters most in life by going through these health challenges.

His passion for technology and process automation began early in his career with an internship with Walt Disney Imagineering, where he cut his teeth on an enterprise-wide migration to Active Directory. From there, he “magically” transitioned to the Orlando Modeling and Simulation community. Dave spent over ten years at JHT working his way through the ranks from programming to leading projects, writing proposals and eventually running business development. To round out his experience, he spent 5 years working and learning about transformative cloud solutions with iQuate, a company based out of Dublin, Ireland. At iQuate, he led large implementations with Fortune 500 customers such as American Express and ExxonMobil before the company was successfully acquired and became CloudSphere, where he continued his passion for customer engagement and process automation. At CloudSphere, Dave navigated the acquisition landscape combining the back-end business systems, including digital marketing, before leaving to return to the modeling and simulation community. These experiences led him to Mass Virtual, where his passion and knowledge for streamlining routine tasks and implementing Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is paramount to the success of increasing the velocity of our business. 

Throughout his professional career, Dave has had a deep enthusiasm in supporting the next generation.

After obtaining his Bachelor’s Degree in Accounting from JU, Mike went on to graduate school where he received his Master’s Degree in Business Administration from Nova Southeastern University in Davie, FL.

These values, deeply rooted in Midwest culture, have been my compass throughout a transformative 17-year accounting career.
As a CFO at Summit Contracting, I experienced a rapid rise, navigating both challenges and triumphs. Amidst the rapid growth, I learned firsthand the complexities of leading a business through turbulent times. The unprecedented challenges of 2020, caused by COVID and supply shortages, tested our resilience. Yet, we emerged stronger, adapting and thriving in a volatile market.  And I am proud to say Summit Contracting is now recognized on the Inc 5000 list. 
My commitment to the growth and financial success of companies extends to my current role as President of Bouwen. At Bouwen, we harness the power of collaboration to drive rural businesses towards unparalleled success by bridging them with invaluable resources from our extensive network.  Bouwen began as a shared resource platform, conceived to streamline our operations across our ownership group. However, it rapidly transformed into a powerhouse team, dedicated to acquisitions, mergers, strategic innovation, and fostering a coveted workplace culture. 
Beyond the professional realm, my personal life has been a tapestry of joys and challenges. Today, as a proud mother of three and married to a devoted farmer, I strive to balance my professional endeavors with a rich and fulfilling personal life. My involvement in community activities, from youth league softball coaching to supporting my children's diverse school engagements, reflects my dedication to community upliftment. A life-altering experience with my youngest daughter's health crisis reshaped my perspective, teaching me the profound significance of empathy, assertiveness, and resilience. Juggling professional responsibilities from hospital rooms, I remain eternally grateful to my family for their unwavering support and to Summit Contracting for their understanding during those testing times.
A cornerstone of my professional journey has been my relationship with Tyler Samuelson, the visionary founder of Summit Contracting and Bouwen. College friends turned family friends; our bond transcends business. The deep trust and understanding we share have been pivotal in our collaborative successes. As Tyler's right-hand, I translate his visions into actionable plans, guiding our teams to manifest those dreams into reality.
In essence, my journey is a testament to the power of hard work, community, relationships, and the ability to adapt and evolve. Through every challenge and triumph, I remain dedicated to empowering businesses, nurturing communities, and cherishing the invaluable lessons life offers.

Hello, I'm John Porrata, a graduate of Florida Atlantic University.  While my journey began as a college promoter in the music industry, a brief stint in insurance after graduation made me realize that my true passion lay in music.

Motivated by this passion, I co-founded a production company with friends from college. This venture paved the way for me to delve deeper into the music industry learning the logistics and operations. This eventually lead to me consulting and eventually opening four college bars/restaurants/venues. In this role, I focused on talent booking, strategic marketing and devised strategies to enhance profitability on slower nights.

My journey through various roles in the music industry ultimately led me to Whet Travel/Groove Cruise. Initially working on the talent management side, I quickly ascended to a leadership role, and I now proudly serve as the Managing Director.

Kevin Simpson is an award winning ActionCOACH, firm owner and professional presenter.
He is ranked globally in the top 50 list of best ActionCoaches and is a two time ActionMan winner as well as Rookie Coach of the Year in his first year with ActionCOACH.

Kevin is Managing Partner of ActionEdge Executive Development ( AEX) leads a team of some of North America’s top executive coaches and together they impact hundreds of companies and business leaders in industries around the world every year..

As well as leading AEX, Kevin is also the Chief Operating Officer of Auto Shield Canada where he brings his combination of coaching and real world leadership experience to a company that produces Warranty and Appearance Protection products for the the automotive industry in North America

Kevin’s belief is that success doesn’t happen by accident - it’s planned, earned through dedicated execution and through his dedication to abundance to be shared. Every detail counts and it is this commitment that comes through in everything he does, every company he works with and every audience he speaks to.


Organizational & Executive Coaching Impact
Kevin’s career began as an Electronic Engineer in the field of medical imaging with Siemens Medical where he grew to become one of the leading MRI technicians in the world. He worked with health care providers in Canada, the United States and all over Europe, then finishing his career at Siemens as their National Technology Manager.

Kevin's expertise in leading teams and developing strategies at Siemens has evolved into three decades of business experience, working with multi-billion dollar companies across Canada and the United States like Shimano, Thule, Brooks Running, Camelbak and the City Of Prince George.
With his energetic and inspirational style, combined with the results from coaching these companies, Kevin realized his true passion - executive coaching. This has led him to starting and growing his own nationally recognized and award winning coaching firm - ActionEdge. 
ActionEdge now has 3 locations across Canada with 6 coaches, 4 of whom are internationally recognized leaders in the ActionCOACH system.


His clients will tell you he is more than their executive coach, he is positioned as one of their board of directors and is with the company’s executive team helping them get clarity on leading their companies - then making sure they execute.

If not in an executive boardroom working with a CEO and their team - Kevin can be found speaking to global and international business audiences around the world.

Community & Family
Kevin served on the board for Big Brothers and Big Sisters and he was President of his former hometown’s Canmore’s Downtown Business Development group. 

His passion for the outdoors and sports has led him from the base of Mount Everest to racing his mountain bike over most of Europe’s highest passes. He is a proud finisher of both the TransAlps and TransRockies Mountain bike races.

He and his partner Bertha with their daughter Aria love to travel - preferably with their bikes and dogs. They share a love of great wine, great food and great dining experiences. They are partners in business and life.        

Kevin’s drive and determination to strategize, plan, execute and then win, all stem from his personal mantra that comes from the ancient Greek Statesman, Pericles:
 Those who can most truly be called brave are those who best know the meaning of what is sweet in life, and what is terrible, and then go out, undeterred, to meet what is coming.

Additionally, our integrated healthcare service line is anchored with community paramedics, enhancing our comprehensive care offerings. We focus on building bridges and opening access to care for under-served and under-resourced communities.

Professional Background:
I joined OFFOR Health in September 2022 as the Executive Director of Logistics, and since then, I've had the privilege of advancing to Vice President of Business Operations and now COO. Before joining OFFOR Health, I proudly served 16 years in the United States Marine Corps, which instilled a strong sense of discipline, resilience, and leadership. After military service, I initially transitioned into the manufacturing sector as an Inventory Control Manager before moving into third party logistics and progressively advancing to executive positions in the 3PL industry. My professional endeavors are driven by data-informed decision-making and a commitment to operational excellence. I have held certifications in Six Sigma as both a SSBB and LSSGB.

Personal Interests:
Outside of my professional life, I am happily married with three wonderful children. They are (shockingly) now all young adults in their 20's. In my leisure time, I enjoy engaging in a good game of chess and delving into thought-provoking books. Some of my favorite reads include ""The Effective Executive"" by Drucker and ""East of Eden"" by Steinbeck.

I am excited to connect with like-minded professionals within the COO Alliance and look forward to sharing insights, learning from each of you, and contributing to our collective growth.

Owner & COO, Five 12 Restaurant Concepts
A native of Lufkin, Texas, Trent Patterson traveled an unexpected route to restaurant operations. After graduating with a degree in electrical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, he ventured into tech as a product development engineer before transitioning to manage an Austin branch of Chick-fil-A. During his four-year tenure, Patterson’s innovative approach transformed the branch into the busiest in t
he country and reshaped the company's nationwide approach to drive-thru service. Rising to
director of operations, he became a grand opening trainer, traveling the country to open new locations. Meanwhile, he discovered his true calling in the hospitality sector. In 2012, Patterson joined forces with college friend Aaron Lyons to bring Lyons’ vision for farm-to table concept Dish Society to fruition. When no one in Austin would lease a restaurant space to an MBA and engineer, the duo launched the first Dish Society in Houston’s Galleria area in 2014. Since then, through constant analysis and adjustment, Patterson and Lyons have opened seven locations, developing a solid following for their polished, approachable food service model. In 2022, under the Five12 Restaurant Concepts umbrella, Lyons and Patterson expanded their portfolio with Daily Gather. The stylish, full-service restaurant in Houston’s CITYCENTRE honors time spent around the shared table and offers a menu of locally sourced American classics updated with global influences. Nearly a decade after Dish Society’s inception, Patterson and Lyons return to Austin to introduce the all-day café to a second market. The first Dish Society in the capital city opened in December 2023 in the up-and-coming Mueller District. Another location is poised to open at Houston’s Hobby Airport in 2024, and the team plans to expand in Austin and across other markets in the coming years. As they grow the brand, Patterson welcomes the opportunity to tackle regional challenges while upholding the values that have defined their success.
Patterson currently serves as Chairman of the Board of the Greater Houston Chapter of the Texas Restaurant Association. In his free time, he enjoys indoor skydiving, attending Longhorn football games, and savoring life with his wife, Caress, and their daughter.",https://secure.kolbe.com/k2/show_viewReports/sharedGuid_9F3B74C6-1C87-EF11-9136-00505682CA54,Iced Tea with Lime,I don't snack,None,Aaron Lyons,aaron@five12rc.com,,,,"Efficiency, innovation, grit, endurance, functional focus, top line vision for volume, bottom line results","organizing and functioning with non operational departments, working with a CEO that is more appearance focused vs function, leadership & management development, reducing fear of growth",,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/trent-patterson-569b6979/,,Hospitality,"dishsociety.com, dailygather.com, proudpie.com",trent@five12rc.com,COO,EO,8/01
